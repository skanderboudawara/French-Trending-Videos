# French YouTube video trending analysis

I decided to put my newly acquired data analytics skills to the test by analyzing a problem that I encounter as a content creator on YouTube. Specifically, I wanted to identify patterns among the videos that successfully appear on the YouTube trending page.

Some of the key questions I aimed to answer included:

- Does writing titles in all caps increase the chances of a video appearing on the trending page?
- Is there a correlation between the number of views and the probability of appearing on the trending page?
- Is there a correlation between the number of comments and the probability of appearing on the trending page?
- Does having a high percentage of likes to views ratio increase the chances of appearing on the trending page?
- What is the best day and time frame for posting a video to increase the chances of appearing on the trending page?

For more detailed information, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for this analysis.
