# French YouTube video trending analysis

After getting my professional google certificate in Data Analytics, I used my new skills to solve a problem I encountered as a content creator on YouTube.
We usually tend to see patterns for the successful videos that find themselves on the YouTube trending page, such as:

* Should we write our titles in CAPSLOCK
* Does the number of views boost the probability of appearing on the trending page?
* Does the number of comments increase the probability of appearing on the trending page?
* Should you have more than a 95% ratio for your video success?
* What is the best day to post your video to appear on the trending page?
* What is the best time frame to post your video to appear on the trending page?
